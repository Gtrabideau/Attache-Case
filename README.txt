Attache Case: A Python Game
Made by: Grant Rabideau

This is a simple puzzle game with 3 levels and a scoreboard which tracks your best times on each level.

This project was used to learn Python, starting with just the basic game, which works off of lists and 2d arrays, and
then learning how to create a GUI, bind keys, interact with outside files, as well as find and create assets.
Throughout the creation of the game, I applied my knowledge of other programming languages to learn and adapt to the
formatting and commands that Python uses as well as utilize my knowledge of programming concepts to create patterns that
are used in many programs.

BASICS OF THE GAME:
Your goal is to place all the items in your list to fill the case completely.
You cannot rotate items and must place them as they are.
The game will complete when you have solved the puzzle, then your time will be added to the leaderboard.

CONTROLS:
Mouse to select buttons
Arrow Keys to change displayed item or to position item.
Enter to select item or confirm item position.
Delete to remove all items from the case.
Backspace to deselect an already selected item.
